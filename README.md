# MiHomeReplacer
An android port of xCape xcReplacer tool.
This project was developed to be used with xCape's MiHome P version.


# What is it
This project aims to simplify the process of traduction of MiHome plugins to the Italian language.


# Status
This project is in Alpha state, so expect major changes (but not that many crashes). 


# Main Features
The project has a few useful features:
 - update of available plugin list
 - check of plugin updates
 - manage available plugins
  
And also a few other tricks, such as:
 - "use best" mode, which uses the latest translated plugin even if the one connected to the MiAccount has not been translated
 - various UI layouts
 - prompt to upload the latest, untraslated plugins to xCape's server to ease the process of translation


# About MiHome
MiHome is Xiaomi's Smart Living Ecosystem manager app: unfortunately, this app is mostly untranslated from chinese to english, so it's not very useful for non chinese speakers.
This app works by using small plugins developed by the devices' manufacturers to communicate with the smart appliances and integrate them in MiHome.


# About MiHome P
Developer xCape mantains a MiHome mod called MiHome P, which has two major advantages:
 - updated translation to Italian;
 - moved the plugin folder from the provate app memory to the external (sdcard) memory.
  
This provides an easy manipulation of plugins, which can be easily translated to any language.
